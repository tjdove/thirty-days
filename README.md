#Solidity #crypto #DeFi 

Learning to write Solidity contracts using Uniswap v3/v4 protocols is an excellent way to dive into decentralized finance (DeFi) development. Below is a structured 30-day plan to help you write 30 Solidity contracts, gradually increasing in complexity. Each day, you'll focus on a specific concept or feature, building on what you've learned previously.

cast call 0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9 "balanceOf(address"   0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545

balanceOf(address account) public override returns (uint256)
